# DIGITAL THERMOMETER USING AVR ATMEGA 8

# Abstract
Global warming is a big problem now a day. People want to be more concerned about the weather. They want to know the temperature and humidity thus they can forecast the weather change. Here digital thermometer based on ATmega8 microcontroller is a big deal. That can sense the temperature from the nature and provide digital output. LCD display can show that result, computer can analyze it and forecast that day’s weather. This result can be applied to airplane, ship, bus, industry etc. This project based on a microcontroller and a temperature sensor has an analog sensor that converts the surrounding’s temperature to a proportional analog voltage. The output from the sensor is connected to one of the ADC channel inputs of the microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format. The computed temperature is displayed in a character LCD in degree centigrade. As it is not so costly, industrially that can be spread out vastly. The day is not so far, when people use that types of device for their daily purpose. And that was our object to construct such a device which can be operated easily and get output smoothly as a normal people can use it. So to construct a user friendly device which can sense the temperature from the nature and cost a little is our object.
